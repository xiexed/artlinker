# Artlinker #

Simple file-tagging program, written in PyQt. I've created it to organize scientific articles in my research work. But it obviously could be used with any file type.

to run it you must specify a path to folder which contains files you want to organize with tags

example:
```
python artlinkerqt.pyw "/home/nickl/articles"
```

besides adding tags you can also add names and comments to files.
